# ASCII2SHIFTJIS
Small little tool designed to help with the translation of ps2 games from english strings to the defined JP counterparts

Currently it is working as a small script when compiled. The input can be be changed to use manual input for source files however I've set them manually just to avoid wasting time with several runs. The tool is designed to be used in conjunction with codedesigner by GtclPimp in combination with subs. This is simply a tool that will allow one to translate strings much faster by including them all in a file and converting them all instead of character by character manually.

The dictionary can be changed to really include anything you would want, atm it is simply working with the character mapping for SB2
